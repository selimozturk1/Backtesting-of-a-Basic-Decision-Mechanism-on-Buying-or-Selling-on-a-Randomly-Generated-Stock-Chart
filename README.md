# Backtesting-of-a-Basic-Decision-Mechanism-for-Buying-or-Selling-on-a-Randomly-Generated-Stock-Chart

This project will consist of several operations.
First one will be generating a random stock chart using Random Walks with Stochastic Processes.
Second one will be creating a basic decision mechanism(such as buy if RSI<30 or sell if RSI>80)
The last one will be testing part, which will consist of different operations but the general idea is to finish it with Monte Carlo operations then to maybe cross validate when
the decision mechanism gets more complex and turned into a real and reasonable algorithm.
If possible, several indicators(MACD,RSI...) will be created to get a sense of their effects on the movement of the graph.
The main goal here is to find how efficient the decision mechanism works.
